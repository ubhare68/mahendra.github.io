Add a World Class Compare Products Feature to your WooCommerce store today with the WooCommerce Compare Products plugin.

== Description ==

The Compare Products extension for WooCommerce gives a product comparison feature that you'd only expect to find on the big corporate e-commerce sites.

Compare Products Lite uses existing WooCommerce Product Categories and Product Attributes to create Compare Categories and Compare Features that can be assigned to each and every product to create a feature comparison table. The [Pro Version](http://a3rev.com/shop/woocommerce-compare-products/) is fully integrated with WooCommerce Product Categories, Product Attributes and their terms.

WooCommerce Compare Products Lite allows users to firstly add products to a compare widget basket, then at the click of a mouse the chosen products can be viewed in a state-of-the-art comparison table.

Chosen products are compared side-by-side, feature by feature, price-by-price. Discard products from the table at the click of a mouse as you hone in on the product that is the one for you. Save the comparison as a PDF or print it.
